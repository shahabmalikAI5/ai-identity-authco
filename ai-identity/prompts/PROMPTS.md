# Reader prompts

Plain-language prompts you paste into your agent (claude.ai, Claude Code, or OpenCode). They are short on purpose — you carry the intent, the spec carries the detail, the skill carries the API. Two kinds:

- **Build prompts** drive a manufacture from a spec.
- **Understand prompts** have no spec; they make you _see_ what you just built, which is where the identity literacy actually forms.

The loop inside every build prompt is the one you already know from Spec-Driven Development: plan → build in small steps → check against the acceptance criteria.

## Lesson 0 — Set up the base · uses `specs/00-set-up-the-base/spec.md`

The base ships no app — your first rep is directing the agent to scaffold it. Full prompts in `specs/00-set-up-the-base/prompts.md`.

> Read `specs/00-set-up-the-base/spec.md` and the "Set up the base" section of `AGENTS.md`. Scaffold the Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn app here, install the Better Auth and shadcn skills, pin the Better Auth 1.7 stack with the kysely override, and wire Neon. Don't build any auth yet. Run the acceptance checks and show me the landing page is up.

## Lesson 1 — Own your sign-in · uses `specs/01-own-your-sign-in/spec.md`

**Build:**

> Read `specs/01-own-your-sign-in/spec.md` and the `better-auth-best-practices` and `email-and-password-best-practices` skills. Plan the approach against our constitution, show me the plan, then build it in small steps. Run the spec's acceptance checks — including the security ones (AC-5..AC-7) — before you call it done.

**Understand (no spec):**

> I just signed up. Show me exactly what got stored in the database for my account, and point out what is NOT there — where's my password, and why can't you show it to me?

> Try to reach `/dashboard` and `/api/me` without signing in, and show me what happens. Explain in plain English what is stopping you.

## Lesson 2 — Become the issuer · uses `specs/02-become-the-issuer/spec.md`

**Build:**

> Read `specs/02-become-the-issuer/spec.md` and the `agent-identity-issuer` skill. Plan it, show me the plan, then build it in small steps. Build the token verifier as a separate script so the checks are real, and run all the acceptance criteria — especially the adversarial ones (AC-4..AC-9).

**Understand (no spec):**

> Fetch my JWKS endpoint and show me what's there. Is my private signing key in it? Prove it, and explain why a stranger can verify my tokens but can't forge one.

> Take an ID token you just issued, decode it, and walk me through every claim — `iss`, `aud`, `sub`, `exp` — in plain English. Then change the `aud` by one character and show me the verifier rejecting it.

> Issue a token, then move the clock past its expiry and try to use it. Show me the exact rejection.

## Lesson 3 — Scopes & consent · uses `specs/03-scopes-and-consent/spec.md`

_(prompts land with the spec)_

## Lesson 4 — Connect a real app · uses `specs/04-connect-a-real-app/spec.md`

_(prompts land with the spec — this is where a separate app signs in with AuthCo)_

## Lesson 5 — Connect a resource server · uses `specs/05-connect-a-resource-server/spec.md`

_(prompts land with the spec — a protected API verifies your RS256 tokens offline)_

## Lesson 6 — Client identity with CIMD · uses `specs/06-client-identity-with-cimd/spec.md`

This is the edge of the core spine: a pre-release plugin and a draft standard. Check the live docs before you code.

**Build:**

> Read `specs/06-client-identity-with-cimd/spec.md` and section 2 of the `agent-identity-issuer` skill. Before writing anything, query the live Better Auth docs MCP at `https://mcp.better-auth.com/mcp` for the current `@better-auth/cimd` API and show me what it returns. Then plan it, move us to the Better Auth 1.7 pre-release channel, and build it in small steps. Run the acceptance checks including the adversarial ones (AC-4..AC-7).

**Understand (no spec):**

> Show me my discovery document before and after, and point at the one new line that says "a client may identify itself by URL." Explain what that flips on.

> Hand my issuer an `http://` `client_id`, then one with a `#fragment`, and show each being refused. Explain why the draft insists on a clean HTTPS URL.

## Projects (the ~50% milestone) — you drive these · `specs/projects/`

After the spine, the course hands you specs and you build them yourself. Prompts live with each project spec (`specs/projects/<name>/prompts.md`).

**Stable — do these at ~50%:**

> Read `specs/projects/2fa/spec.md` and `specs/projects/social-login/spec.md`. Plan both, show me the plan, then build them in small steps — harden the sign-in you already own with a second factor, and add a "Continue with Google" door. Run every acceptance check, including the adversarial security ones.

**Frontier — Half 2, on `@better-auth/agent-auth` (beta):**

> Read `specs/projects/agent-credential/spec.md` and `specs/projects/on-behalf-of/spec.md`. This is the beta agent surface — pin the version and treat the API as one instantiation of the durable primitives (own credential, least-privilege scope, finite expiry, human approval, revocable). Plan it, build it in small steps, and hold the acceptance criteria even if the calls have moved.
